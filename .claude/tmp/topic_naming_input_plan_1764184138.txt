Review /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Papers/ProgrammaticSemantics/outline/paper_outline.md in order to plan a systematic revision of this detailed outline to reduce redundancy, improve clarity and concision of the exposition, and improve the narrative arc which clear indicators for TODOs where more information is needed or a task remains to be done, as well as NOTE indicators for sections that do not make a substantial contribution to the primary arc of the paper. The aim is to provide a strong outline with all points articulated or TODOs included to serve as a basis for the research article /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Papers/ProgrammaticSemantics/paper/sn-article.tex which is intended to be submitted to the Journal of Automated Reasoning.
