# Call for papers

There has recently been a growing interest in truthmaker semantics as an alternative to the standard possible-worlds approach in philosophical and formal semantics.

The aim of the conference is to share recent advances in truthmaker semantics and related approaches, as well as to strengthen the intellectual ties within the community.

While there is no fee for participation, those not presenting will be asked to pay for any conference dinners they wish to attend (estimated 35 Euro per day).
