\section*{\it Abstract}

This talk presents a \textit{programmatic methodology} which uses the \href{https://pypi.org/project/model-checker/}{\texttt{model-checker}} software that I developed with help from Miguel Buitrago during his UROP at MIT to rapidly prototype truthmaker semantic theories.

We will begin by presenting a standard methodology in philosophical logic to highlight a number of shortcomings which motivate a programmatic methodology.
We will then introduce the \texttt{model-checker} which draws on the SMT solver Z3 to rule out finite countermodels of a user specified size to provide evidence that there are no countermodels to the logical consequence in question.
Rather than displacing traditional methods, implementing a programmatic semantics with the \texttt{model-checker} supports the development of a model theory and proof theory for a language.

In order to make the workflow concrete, we will present two case studies, the first of which compares implementations of \citepos{Fine2012a,Fine2012b} \textit{imposition semantics} for counterfactual conditionals with the extension provided in \cite{Brast-McKie2025}.
After demonstrating the tooling that the \texttt{model-checker} provides for theory analysis and comparison, we will turn to present some of the difficulties faced in attempting to implement \citepos{Champollion2024} unilateral semantics for negation.
In addition to the standard theoretical virtues, these case studies will shed light on the \textit{computability} of a semantic theory which the \texttt{model-checker} makes salient.

In addition to facilitating the study of complex semantic theories, the \texttt{model-checker} provides resources for uploading semantic theories to the \texttt{TheoryLib} to facilitate collaboration.
Programmatic semantic theories are also modular, making them easy to combine and compare, allowing users to survey the interactions in languages with many operators.
Moreover, the computability of a semantic theory provides an objective measure that may be weighed alongside other theoretical virtues.

Although the \texttt{model-checker} is a general purpose utility for working in semantics, applications in hyperintensional semantics are particularly natural given the increased complexity of these semantic systems. 
Rather than a deficiency, we will characterize well-motivated forms of theoretical complexity as a sign of the maturity of semantics as a discipline.
It is in support of both the future development and accessibility of semantics that the \texttt{model-checker} aims to make a contribution.
The talk will conclude by presenting the \texttt{proof-checker} which provides a complementary utility for developing the proof theory and metalogic in the LEAN proof assistant.

% SUMMARY
% This talk presents a programmatic methodology that uses the model-checker to rapidly prototype modular semantic theories for the Logos. This approach leverages the Z3 SMT solver to automatically search for finite countermodels, providing evidence for logical consequences while making it easier to explore and combine complex semantic theories in a collaborative framework.

      \item Exclusion replaces possibility and falsification
      \item Semantic clause for negation makes up for the difference
      \item Ideological and semantic complexity are hard to measure 
      \item Computability is an objectively measurable theoretical virtue
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{proof-checker} (5 min - Brast-McKie)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The \texttt{model-checker} extends the standard methodology
      \item Provides evidence in support of logical consequences
      \item Supports the development of a proof theory and metalogic
